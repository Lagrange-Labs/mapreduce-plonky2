## Hook Installation

To install hooks in this file, from the root directory navigate to `./.git/hooks`. Then replace the corresponding file with the one in this folder. If you haven't installed any hooks before it will be called `<file-name>.sample` instead of just `<file-name>`. You may also 
have to make the files inside `./.git/hooks` executable by running `chmod +x ./.git/hooks/*` from the project root.
