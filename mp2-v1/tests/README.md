## Local test contract

The local test contracts are organized by [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry),
it must be installed as a prerequisite.

The test contracts are located in `mp2-v1/test-contracts`.

The Rust binding code is generated automatically when running `cargo build`.
But it could also be generated by `make int_bind` manually.
